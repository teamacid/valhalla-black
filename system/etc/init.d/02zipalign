# Automatic ZipAlign by Wes Garner
# ZipAlign files in /data that have not been previously ZipAligned (using md5sum)
# Thanks to oknowton for the changes

# Changelog:
# 1.1 (12/1/09) Switched to zipalign -c 4 to check the apk instead of MD5 (oknowton)
# 1.0 (11/30/09) Original
# Output the script name for easier run-parts debugging
echo Now running $0

mkdir -p /data/logs/
LOG_FILE=/data/logs/zipalign.log

# If we find the log file and it's 7 days old, then we delete it
find $LOG_FILE -type f -mtime +7
if test -f $LOG_FILE; then
  # If the log was found by now, it means it was less than a week old, so we exit
  echo '  zipalign was run less than 7 days ago, exiting'
  exit

# Since it's been more than a week since we ran the zipalign, create a new log file
